# Description
- I have designed and developed a `File Management Web Application using Django` that will allow users to add, update, and delete files using Django.
- The web application supports `pdf, image, document, audio, and video files` The User Registration allows the user to register themselves to upload the files, files that are already uploaded can be downloaded without login.
- `The Add File allows the user to add title, description, and upload the file in any of the supported formats`
- The Edit File allows the uploaded file to be changes.
- The Delete File allows the user to delete files that they have uploaded. User can edit the description and details of their profile.
- The Django Admin Interface allows the site administrator to `view, add, edit` and delete any files and users on the application.
- Technologies used - `Python, Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript`
